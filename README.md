# Simulation-of-Queuing-System
Simulation of Queuing System was the Course I took after taking the Queuing Theory (advanced).
we have 5 servers.
The distribution of servers' service time: 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. All distributions are exponential and only averages (in seconds)
Distribution of incoming messages: Exponential distribution with an average of 3.3 seconds.
we run the simulation by deploying one police and run it for 700 times
